FAQ:
>Why bother?
It's a pretty 
based hobby if you like getting wet. Staying and breathing underwater 
for longer periods of time exposes you to a completely different world 
and experience. You should at least try this once in your lifetime. 
Also, there's no talking underwater (except occasional hand signals), so
 you won't have to deal with nagging from other people except for a 
short period on the surface.
>Is it expensive?
Any
 hobby has its expenses. If you choose to own your own gear instead of 
renting it you'll quickly drive up quite a hefty cost. However, if you 
turn out to be an active diver the initial investment is usually worth 
it over time.
>Isn't SCUBA diving dangerous?
Yes,
 you could die with very little effort (hold your breath and ascend: 
boom, you're dead). You should keep this in mind every time you dive. 
The risk is worth it though, and quite low when it comes to recreational
 diving between or shallower than 18-20 meters.
>Can I dive alone?
Only if you accept x2 the risk of dying.
>Where do I start?
Get
 certified (beware Ko Tao in Thailand though). There are many 
organizations who certify divers, notable among them PADI, SSI, GUE, 
CMAS. PADI is probably the largest organization, but is usually a little
 more expensive than alternatives. Before even getting certified though 
practice only breathing through your mouth.

FAQ continued:
>Why learn breathing only through your mouth?
Besides
 likely getting water in your mask while diving at some point, there's 
mask flooding and mask off exercises in the course. You don't want to 
bolt to the surface in a panic because you suddenly snorted some water. 
For practice, try snorkeling with swimming goggles (which won't cover 
your nose). Don't forget about mask squeeze though (see video in guide).
>Where to dive?
The guide is sparse for now, but if you can't find anything there then ask ITT.
>Best way to log dives?
Subsurface
 is free as in freedom software for logging and planning dives, and it's
 quite possibly the best software out there. A physical logbook is also 
fine and should probably be used in conjunction with it.

### Vacation/regular diver
If you're not planning on diving more than maybe a few times a year, perhaps only during summer, then you'll probably fine with just using rental gear. If the service and maintenance of such gear, especially regulators, has you worried about breathing through moldy equipment, it might be an idea to at the very least get yourself your own regulators.

As a vacation diver chances are you'll enjoy most of your time in warm waters, so 1st and 2nd stages with features for cold water are likely unnecessary. Although most regulators you'll find in your local dive shop are likely fine, the main thing to consider when picking one is comfort. This includes the comfort of the mouth piece (if you need to bite down a lot over time you'll quickly get jaw fatigue) and comfort of breathing. Many regulators allow you to adjust how easy it is for you to breathe, and this is likely to change as soon as you're underwater. Some have features like a two step free flow button, the ability to install the hose and adjusting knob on the other side if you like, or a mouth piece with its own inner part to bite down (see Apeks XTX50 as an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhqArigpvfw).

Regardless which regulators and first stage you go for, it's recommended to maybe consider a different setup from, for example, the standard PADI one with a primary regulator and a long octopus for sharing air. Instead, consider getting a long hose which will serve as your primary reg. and also the reg. for donating air, and having a backup reg. right below your chin attached around your neck with a bungee cord which you should be able to put in your mouth without even using your hands. A panicked diver is likely going for the one you're breathing from anyway, and the long hose also makes donating air more comfortable for both parties. It's also likely quicker to offer the reg. that's already in your mouth in an S-drill (look it up) than trying to find your octo. There's nothing inherently wrong with the standard setup, however, so whichever you choose to go for is fine.

Although you don't dive often, another consideration might be a BCD and a weight belt. You should have no issue with whatever weight belt on offer for rental, but they tend to be fairly standard straps where the weights have a tendency to shift around in which can be uncomfortable. A better option is to get your own (plastic or metal buckle should largely perform the same) which is a bit thicker and more rubbery (higher friction material) to ensure weights stay in their place during a dive. You might also consider getting pockets you can attach somewhere around the shoulder of your BCD to have weights in to improve trim. As for a BCD, you're unlikely to go wrong with rental. They're all quite similar jacket styles with pockets, D-rings, exhaust valves (top and bottom), etc. It probably won't take up too much weight/space in your suitcase when traveling, and it might be nice to have a BCD you know you're comfortable with.

You could also consider a BPW. You're likely to get better trim with it, there's far less unnecessary features like you have on your standard BCD, it's more extensible (so you could make it BCD like), and it's likely to take up less space in your baggage since it's either a more sparse jacket style like BCD or just a harness, bladder, and a backplate. You can also go for a light-weight backplate to save yourself more weight. However, this might be going a bit far for your average vacation diver.

A dive computer is another consideration. Depending on what you go for, you might be able to transfer dive log data to your PC so you can log your dives on something like Subsurface, where you might be able to see your gas consumption (if you have a pod and compatible computer), tissue saturation, etc, which is neat. A dive computer won't take up much space either so it could be a worthwhile investment. A regular diver might should consider going for something which could serve you well should you ever consider trying technical diving, like a Shearwater Perdix, Heinrichs Weikamp, or a Suunto EON Core (EON Steel goes to 150m unlike the Core's 80m).

A wetsuit (or semi-dry suit) can be a worthwhile investment if you find a really food fitting one. There will be less circulation in a good fitting wetsuit, which means better thermal performance.This is one piece of equipment which isn't easily adjustable after the fact, and it's better to know you're not swimming in something someone else has peed in (rental). A drysuit is another consideration since it adds a backup buoyancy device and actually keeps you dry, but will quickly add up to a lot of weight for travel, especially if you go for neoprene instead of a shellsuit. The latter would serve you well in technical diving, and you can pretty much use it in any climate. Some people are more comfortable with wetsuits though.

If you're a regular diver, why rent anything? Bring your own gear, and maybe half of it if you're going on vacation. A twinset could be a worthwhile investment, and will serve you well into technical diving if you have any plans of ever doing that. However, if people around you are mostly using a single cylinder, you might just end up just carrying extra air for nothing (unless you use a lot of air). Twinsets also requires backplate mounting, which means less compatibility with single cylinders if you were to take your BPW with you on vacation.

One worthwhile investment is in a longhose and neckreg setup (DIR setup), regardless whether you go with a twinset (two first stages) or a single cylinder. See equipment guide.

## FAQ:
##### Why bother?
It's a pretty based hobby if you like getting wet. Staying and breathing underwater for longer periods of time exposes you to a completely different world and experience. You should at least try this once in your lifetime. Also, there's no talking underwater (except occasional hand signals), so you won't have to deal with nagging from other people except for a short period on the surface.
##### Is it expensive?
Any hobby has its expenses. If you choose to own your own gear instead of renting it you'll quickly drive up quite a hefty cost. However, if you turn out to be an active diver the initial investment is usually worth it over time.
##### Isn't SCUBA diving dangerous?
Yes, you could die with very little effort (hold your breath and ascend: boom, you're dead). You should keep this in mind every time you dive. The risk is worth it though, and quite low when it comes to recreational diving between or shallower than 18-20 meters.
##### Can I dive alone?
Only if you accept x2 the risk of dying.
##### Where do I start?
Get certified. There are many organizations who certify divers, notable among them PADI, SSI, GUE, CMAS. PADI is probably the largest organization, but is usually a little more expensive than alternatives. Before even getting certified though practice only breathing through your mouth.
###### Why learn breathing only through your mouth?
Besides likely getting water in your mask while diving at some point, there's mask flooding and mask off exercises in the course. You don't want to bolt to the surface in a panic because you suddenly snorted some water. To practice this skill, try snorkeling with swimming goggles (which won't cover your nose).
##### Best way to log dives?
Subsurface is free as in freedom software for logging and planning dives, and it's quite possibly the best software out there. A physical logbook is also fine and should probably be used in conjunction with it.
